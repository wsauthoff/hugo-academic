Hello, my name is Wilson and my mission is to better characterize the hydrological environments below Antarctica’s ice sheets using remote sensing, geophysics, and modeling. I am also deeply interested in science communication and how science translates to policy. My goal is to contribute meaningful research findings, educate, and champion science-based decision making.
